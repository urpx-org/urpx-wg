## Description

A standardized, machine-accessible format and Common Service API specification for representing and exchanging utility rate plan data.

## Overview

URPX (Utility Rate Plan Exchange) is an open semantic standard that provides a comprehensive, standardized method for representing rate plan data from distribution, retail, and other utility service providers — including energy, water, and other utilities — in machine-accessible format. The standard defines a modular ontology — covering rate plan structures, charge classifications, eligibility rules, applicability conditions, geographic territories, and temporal versioning — and a Common Service API specification, enabling governments, utilities, vendors, and technology companies to exchange rate plan information in a consistent, interoperable way.

While standards exist for customer usage data (Green Button / NAESB REQ.21 Energy Services Provider Interface (ESPI)) and grid operations (CIM), no comprehensive standard exists for the rate plan data that determines how customers are charged. Today, vendors handling rate plan calculations work in silos using custom logic and proprietary data structures. There is no standard format for representing the logic and customer profile attributes needed to compute costs accurately, and no integration with emissions or renewable energy credit data. In deregulated markets, this problem compounds: retail energy suppliers must represent and compare rate plans across multiple distribution utilities, each with its own proprietary format, making it difficult to offer transparent pricing to customers. This fragmentation creates barriers to innovation, competition, and transparency in energy markets: customers cannot easily compare rate plans, vendors must build custom integrations for each utility territory, and those tasked with cost data ingest and cost estimation struggle with data quality across territories. URPX addresses this by defining a single semantic model and API specification that any party can implement, reducing the integration problem from N proprietary formats to one shared standard.

Initiated by [Flux Tailor](https://fluxtailor.com/) with collaboration from the National Laboratory of the Rockies (NLR), URPX was contributed to LF Energy in 2025 to ensure open, vendor-neutral governance. Flux Tailor serves as working group chair, guiding the specification's development within LF Energy's collaborative standards ecosystem. NLR maintains the Utility Rate Database (URDB), and a formal MOU governs the collaboration between the two organizations on open standard development. While the URPX ontology can reference URDB data, the two formats serve different purposes: URDB contains summary-level pricing data, whereas URPX defines structured rate plan representations with executable cost modeling logic, eligibility criteria, and applicability conditions that go well beyond what URDB captures. The standard is built on W3C semantic web technologies (RDF, OWL, SHACL) with data instances in JSON-LD, made available through GraphQL or REST APIs. From simple flat-rate plans to complex ratchet and time-of-use structures and highly dynamic pricing, URPX provides the shared language required to compute costs accurately and consistently.

## Technical Profile

### What It Does

Defines a standardized ontology, exchange format, and Common Service API specification for utility rate plan data, including rate structures, charge types, eligibility rules, applicability conditions, and temporal versioning, enabling machine-readable representation and programmatic exchange of rate plan information across utility territories.

### Problem(s) Solved

Eliminates the need for vendors and technology companies to reverse-engineer each utility's proprietary rate plan data structures. Provides a common semantic model and API that enables consistent rate plan representation across utilities, allowing customers to compare rate plans, retail energy suppliers in deregulated markets to offer transparent pricing across distribution territories, vendors to scale across territories without custom integrations, DER developers to integrate structured pricing signals into optimization and control systems, and regulators to perform reliable analysis with lower data integration costs.

### Key Capabilities

- Comprehensive rate plan ontology in RDF/OWL covering core rate plan structure and cost model, charge classifications and calculation logic, geographic applicability and jurisdiction, and organizational and regulatory metadata — representing everything from simple flat-rate plans to complex ratchet and time-of-use structures and highly dynamic pricing
- Common Service API specification (REST and GraphQL) for programmatic discovery, retrieval, and querying of published rate plan data, with SPARQL endpoint for advanced semantic queries
- Multiple document types: rate plans, rate plan modifiers (add-on pricing that layers onto a base rate plan), tariff book documents, tariff statement documents (PSC filings), supply prices documents (competitive market pricing), real-time prices documents, and DER export prices
- Rich eligibility rules that define who qualifies for a rate plan, evaluating customer profile attributes (customer class, entity type, tax status, income level) and service point attributes (connection type, voltage level, service territory, DER capability)
- Applicability conditions that define when charges apply, evaluating usage conditions (thresholds, demand levels, power factor), time conditions (TOU periods, seasons, billing cycles, day types), and other conditions (service territory, voltage level)
- Rule evaluation logic with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), comparison operators, and multiple condition types (customer-based, usage-based, time-based, geographic, measurement)
- Temporal versioning and regulatory tracking of rate plan definitions, including full version history and structured tracking of proposed, approved, and retired plans
- Standards alignment with formal SKOS-based mappings to Green Button / NAESB REQ.21 ESPI (rate plan context for usage data), LF Energy CDS (account and billing data alignment), CIM (grid operations), and OpenADR (demand response); interoperability with M2M communication standards including IEEE 2030.5 (SEP) and Matter
- Data validation and conformance using SHACL constraints for schema validation, conformance testing, and data quality enforcement
- Data instances in JSON-LD, accessible through GraphQL or REST APIs
- Reference implementation (planned)
- Test data repository for implementation validation (planned)

### Relevant Standards

URPX is itself an emerging standard — a new open semantic standard for rate plan data exchange. It does not implement an existing industry standard; it aims to become one. URPX is built on W3C semantic web standards (RDF, OWL, SHACL, JSON-LD) and provides formal semantic mappings to related industry standards including Green Button (NAESB REQ.21 ESPI), CIM, LF Energy CDS, and OpenADR. The URPX specification will be released under a W3C license.

## Related Projects

- **CDS Customer Data**: Complementary — CDS Customer Data defines how authorized third parties access customer energy data (accounts, billing, usage) from utilities via standardized APIs. URPX defines the standardized format for rate plan data that applies to those customers. A third party using CDS Customer Data to pull customer usage data would need URPX-formatted rate plans to calculate bill impacts. Specific integration points include service account references, billing cycle synchronization, and service agreement attributes used in URPX eligibility rules.
- **CDS Registration**: Complementary — CDS Registration defines how third parties discover utility API capabilities and establish secure connections. URPX leverages CDS Registration's Server Metadata for geographic territory mapping and utility capability discovery, providing the upstream connectivity layer needed to access URPX-formatted rate plan data from utilities.

**Full description (200 words):**
URPX (Utility Rate Plan Exchange) addresses a critical gap in energy data infrastructure. While standards exist for customer usage data (Green Button / NAESB REQ.21 ESPI) and grid operations (CIM), no comprehensive standard existed for the rate plan data that determines how customers are charged for energy.

Today's utility rate plan landscape is fragmented. Each vendor uses proprietary systems for cost calculations. Rate plan data in machine-accessible form is rarely available from utilities. When it is available, there is no standard format for the logic, eligibility rules, or customer profile attributes needed to compute costs accurately.

URPX acts as the semantic switchboard for transforming flat rate plan data into structured rate plans with executable cost modeling instructions. Built on W3C semantic web technologies (RDF, OWL, SHACL), the standard provides a modular ontology for rate plan structures, machine-readable eligibility and applicability rules, temporal versioning with regulatory approval tracking, formal mappings to Green Button, LF Energy CDS, and other standards, and a Common Service API specification for programmatic access.

Initiated by Flux Tailor with formal NLR collaboration, URPX is developed through open collaboration under LF Energy Standards and Specifications (LFESS) governance.

## Additional Notes

URPX is positioned as an interoperability standard that complements — rather than competes with — existing vendor solutions and data sources. The standard aims to provide a common data layer that enables the broader ecosystem, including DER optimization platforms, customer engagement platforms, and energy service providers.

While NLR's URDB is a valuable resource for utility rate plan data, the relationship between URDB and URPX is one of complementary scope rather than direct data transposition. URDB contains summary-level pricing data; URPX defines structured, semantically rich rate plan representations with executable cost modeling logic, eligibility criteria, and applicability conditions. The formal MOU between NLR and Flux Tailor governs collaboration on the open standard, and mapping pathways between the two formats are under development.

Standardized, machine-readable access to rate plan data is an emerging regulatory topic. Regulators are increasingly referencing standards like Green Button (NAESB REQ.21 ESPI) for customer data access; URPX positions itself as the analogous standard for rate plan data, which regulators could reference for rate plan publication requirements. For DER developers and aggregators, structured rate plan data with time-of-use schedules and export pricing enables optimization algorithms that respond to price signals, supporting grid flexibility and customer cost savings.
